/* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	        Description	                                Example	
+	        Addition	    Adds together two values	                x + y	
-	        Subtraction	    Subtracts one value from another	        x - y	
*	        Multiplication	Multiplies two values	                    x * y	
/	        Division	    Divides one value by another	            x / y	
%	        Modulus	        Returns the division remainder	            x % y	
++	        Increment	    Increases the value of a variable by 1	    x++	
--	        Decrement	    Decreases the value of a variable by 1	    x--



ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR

A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	Example	    Same As
=	        x = 5	    x = 5	
+=	        x += 3	    x = x + 3	
-=	        x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
*=	        x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
/=	        x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
%=	        x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
&=	        x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
|=	        x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
^=	        x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
>>=	        x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
<<=	        x <<= 3	    x = x << 3


COMPARISON OPERATORS

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	                    Example	Try it
==	        Equal to	                x == y	
!=	        Not equal	                x != y	
>	        Greater than	            x > y	
<	        Less than	                x < y	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y


LOGICAL OPERATORS

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	Name	        Description	                                                Example
&& 	        Logical and	    Returns true if both statements are true	                x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	        Logical or	    Returns true if one of the statements is true	            x < 5 || x < 4	
!	        Logical not	    Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	    !(x < 5 && x < 10)
